<info>"The Shambles is an old street in with overhanging timber-framed buildings, some dating back as far as the fourteenth century. It was once known as The Great Flesh Shambles, probably from the Anglo-Saxon Fleshammels (literally 'flesh-shelves'), the word for the shelves that butchers used to display their meat. As recently as 1872 there were twenty-five butchers' shops in the street but now there are none. Today the Shambles is Europe's most visited street, attracting tourist, shoppers and business clients.</info>

<name>The Treasure's House</name>
<lat>53.962984</lat>,
<lng>-1.080623</lng>
<info>The Treasurer's House is an historic house owned by the National Trust. In medieval times it was the home of treasurers of York Minster. It served in this capacity until 1547, after which it passed through a number of private owners. The present house bears little resemblance to the original structure as there has been much rebuilding. The house was restored to its present state by Frank Green, a wealthy local industrialist, between 1897 and 1930. The house and its contents were given to the National Trust in 1930, when its owner retired and moved away from York. Local legend has it that, when a work man was repairing the plumbing in the cellars, he saw a frightening apparition of a group of Roman legionaries marching past.</info>

<site><name>Fairfax House</name>
<lat>53.957275</lat>
<lng> -1.080956</lng>
<info>A classical architectural masterpiece of its age, Fairfax House was originally the winter home of Viscount Fairfax. Its richly decorated interior was designed by York’s most distinguished eighteenth-century architect, John Carr. Extensively adapted in the twentieth century as a cinema and dance hall, Fairfax House was saved from decay and returned to its former glory by York Civic Trust in 1982-84. Today, Fairfax House once more transports you to the splendour of city-living in Georgian York, the centre of polite society. The superb Noel Terry collection of furniture, clocks, paintings and decorative arts, described by Christie’s as one of the finest private collections of the twentieth century, perfectly complements the house, bringing it to life and creating a special lived-in feeling.</info>

<site><name>The Hospitium</name>
<lat>53.961316</lat>
<lng>-1.089427</lng>
<info>This timber-framed building was built in the early 1300s, and is believed to have been used as lodging for weary travelers visiting St. Mary's Abbey. It's not known for sure what it was originally used for, the official listing of the building suggests that it was a place for visitors to stay.  There was a gate onto the river right next to the Hospitium so  it would have been well placed to serve guests arriving by boat. The Hospitium has had several different uses and a number of renovations over the years.  The earliest images show it used as a farm building or derelict.  In the 19th century, the Yorkshire Philosophical Society  repaired the building and used it to display museum objects.  In the 1930s the upper storey was extended with a new roof.</info><image>Hospitium</image></site>

<lng>-1.079974</lng>
<info>Clifford's Tower is all that remains of York Castle. It's set upon a mound which was originally built by William the Conqueror. After a major explosion in 1684 rendered the remaining military defences uninhabitable, the tower continued to be used as a jail and prison until 1929. In 1190, 150 local Jews were killed in a pogrom in the castle keep. Henry III rebuilt the castle in stone in the middle of the 13th century, creating a keep with a unique quatrefoil design, supported by an outer bailey wall and a substantial gatehouse.</info><image>CliffordsTower</image></site>
